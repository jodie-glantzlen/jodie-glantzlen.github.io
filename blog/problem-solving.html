            <h3>Elegant problem solving</h3>
            <p>
              Step 9 of the <a href="https://github.com/jodie-glantzlen/DOM-interactions" target="_blank">DOM interactions</a> challenge:
              As per the instructions, I increased the count of each property in the <code>totals</code> object one by one, like so:
            </p>
            <img src="../resources/images/carbon.png" alt=""class="img-shadow">
            <p>
              As I was writing the code line by line, something felt weird. I thought <em>"I'm pretty sure this isn't DRY, surely there's an alternative"</em>. 
              And there was! The answer was right under my nose a few lines later: a loop. I used the one that was given to us (for another function) as a reference, 
              and ended up with this:
            </p>
            <img src="../resources/images/carbon (1).png" alt="" class="img-shadow">
            <p>
              And it worked! I don't know if it falls under the "elegant problem-solving" category, but I felt quite happy with myself. The processes used 
              in this example are <em>improving my code with reflection</em> and <em>trying something</em>. I wasn't confident at all it would work, but I tried anyway,
              and there you go. This experience taught me to always play around with my code if I can, and keep my eyes open for hints or tools that are not explicitly
              given to us!
