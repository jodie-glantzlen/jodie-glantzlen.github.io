            <h3>Elegant problem solving</h3>
            <p>
              Step 9 of the <a href="https://github.com/jodie-glantzlen/DOM-interactions" target="_blank">DOM interactions</a> challenge:
              As per the instructions, I increased the count of each property in the <code>totals</code> object one by one, like so:
            </p>
            <img src="../resources/images/carbon.png" alt=""class="img-shadow">
            <p>
              As I was writing the code line by line, something felt weird. I thought <em>"I'm pretty sure this isn't DRY, surely there's an alternative"</em>. 
              And there was! The answer was right under my nose a few lines later: a loop. I used the one that was given to us (for another function) as a reference, 
              and ended up with this:
            </p>
            <img src="../resources/images/carbon (1).png" alt="" class="img-shadow">
            <p>
              And it worked! I don't know if it falls under the "elegant problem-solving" category, but I felt quite happy with myself. The processes used 
              in this example are <em>improving my code with reflection</em> and <em>trying something</em>. I wasn't confident at all it would work, but I tried anyway,
              and there you go. This experience taught me to always play around with my code if I can, and keep my eyes open for hints or tools that are not explicitly
              given to us!
            </p>
            <h3>Simple problem</h3>
            <p>
              bla bla bla lorem ipsum stuff
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2 id="#techniques">Problem-solving techniques</h2>
            <h3>Improving code with reflection and trying something</h3>
            <p>
              These two are interdependent in my opinion. At this stage of my coding journey there's only so much improvement I can do but
              I will implement it regularly once I progress further. What I like to do is trying something, test it, comment it, try something else,
              test it, and so on.
            </p>
            <h3>Googling</h3>
            <p>
              I use Google all the time. If the documentation doesn't help or if I don't understand it completely, I know there's probably a thousand people out 
              there who faced a similar problem or tried to achieve what I want to achieve. Looking at other people's code is great for learning as well.
            </p>
            <h3>Rubber Ducky</h3>
            <p>
              As cute as the duck is, we haven't had the chance to meet yet.
            </p>
            <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
            <p>
              It doesn't really come naturally to me to write it down, it's mostly happening in my head at this stage. But I see how it can be helpful when used on
              bigger, more complex projects.
            </p>
            <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
            <p>
              Yup, these are 100% helpful. Obviously my first reaction when seeing them is <em>"Oh no, what is it this time"</em>, but on several occasions 
              they helped me figure out where my code was wrong and most importantly, what was wrong with it. Sometimes it's just a typo, but if you're not looking 
              for it, good luck figuring out what's going on.
            </p>
            <h3>Console.logging</h3>
            <p>
              My best friend #2, with Google. It's like a translator that helps me communicate with my code. If my code is working, I can see it with 
              <code>console.log</code>. If it's not, I can see it thanks to <code>console.log</code> too.
            </p>
            <h3>Asking peers/coaches for help</h3>
            <p>
              I try to ask for help only as a last resort, when I'm truly, fully stuck, when none of the above works, or when I run out of brain power.
