            <h2 id="q1">Three things I learned about myself</h2>
            <p>
              Despite struggling at first with introspection, it turns out I have a high level of self-awareness. It's good news,
              as I'll be able to use it to 'survive' Bootcamp.
            </p>
            <p>
              Adopting the growth mindset is easier said than done, especially when you grew up with strong and well anchored
              assumptions about your own abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Neuroplasticity is amazing and I can already feel it working after only five weeks of coding everyday.

          <div>
            <h2 id="q2">The roles of value, empathy and self-awareness in programming</h2>
            <p>
              It's easy to get lost in the technical side of programming and forget about who you are as an individual.
              Your profession or level of technical skills don't define you, but how you interact with other human beings and 
              hold to your values do.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2 id="q3">What surprised me the most about core learning</h2>
            <p>
              I found it sometimes similar to coding actually. Starting can be challenging, but once you do, there's so much to learn
              and I found myself down rabbit holes several times.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2 id="q4">The most challenging aspects of core learning</h2>
            <p>
              Sometimes it was a bit hard to take my mind away from the technical side of things and re-focus on myself.
              Introspection is a skill that needs practice.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2 id="q5">Why core learning in a programming bootcamp?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>"Hire for fit, train for skill"</em><br>
              You can teach anyone to code, but you can't teach kindness or team spirit! Core learning enabled me to reflect on
              my strengths and weaknesses which is helpful on many aspects. I feel like I now have tools to build resilience
              for all the Bootcamp challenges. It'll also help me find the right fit in future job applications. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2 id="q6">Core learning: a waste of time?</h2>
            <p>
              I don't think any time spent reflecting or practicing introspection is a waste of time. Mental health and 
              self-awareness are essential, more so than technical skills. It's hard to learn anything, not just programming, if you can't 
              get into the right mindset.
