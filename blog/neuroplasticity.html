            <p>
              Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can benefit people as they can escape (their) set beliefs and achieve new things
              that they might have thought impossible. It's a pretty powerful concept that could change many lives. Powerful doesn't mean magical however: there needs to 
              be a commitment to change and effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              Engaging with these principles will help me deconstruct the beliefs that I grew up with (not good at maths, not "nerdy" enough, not a logical brain...) and unlearn
              my self-undermining habits. I understand that it will take lots of work, sweat and tears, but it is possible! Believing in these principles is key for success 
              on many aspects of life. Building new neuro-pathways will help me grow as a professional and individual. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The best way to increase neuroplasticity is to practice everyday, and enjoy the ride. Accepting that making mistakes means growing, because
              I learn from them. But also giving my brain the time it needs to process everything and being forgiving towards myself.

            <p>
              Growth Mindset is the understanding that my intelligence and abilities are <em>not</em> predetermined and therefore can be developed 
              (thanks to neuroplasticity).
            </p>
            <p>
              Learning about the Growth Mindset made me feel more confident in my ability to tackle this challenging EDA journey. It gave me reassurance and hope.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will integrate it in my learning journey by reminding myself everyday that I'm starting a brand new and unknown chapter of my life and for every new challenge,
              there is a process time that needs to be embraced.
