            <h2 id="career">My long term career pathway</h2>
            <p>
              I can think of two main options for me. Either work for a web-development or SAAS company, or work 
              freelance on personal projects my partner and I have. It’s too early to say, because even though I’m 
              enjoying this course so far and I like front-end development, I have no idea what being a web 
              developer really involves (I have never done back-end, or database, or even languages other than JS, 
              CSS and HTML). Maybe I’ll realise being in the heart of tech is not for me and I’ll turn to other 
              options while staying in the industry. 
              <p>Long story short, I don’t know! One step at a time is my motto.</p>
            </p>
            <div>
              <h2 id="learning-style">My learning style: strengths and limits</h2>
              <p>
                My strong empathetic nature helps me understand people’s needs and feelings. I’m good at always 
                choosing my words carefully or behaving in a mindful way. This makes me a good team player. I’ve 
                always thought learning and growing together as a group is more effective and powerful, which is 
                the main reason why I enrolled in this course. I’ve tried twice to learn on my own and never 
                succeeded. However, as an INFJ, I’m very sensitive and prone to stress and anxiety. This can be 
                both a strength and weakness. I’ve used stress before as a really effective motivator. But in 
                negative environments where I don’t feel supported or listened to, it sucks all my energy and 
                motivation away and tends to freeze me. It all comes down again to empathy and finding the right fit!
              </p>
              <div>
                <h2 id="human-skills">Human skills: a new hope</h2>
                <p>
                  I hope to work on my self-confidence and truly embrace the growth mindset. I’ve always convinced 
                  myself that my brain was not logical, that I was not “nerdy” enough. I want to deconstruct my set 
                  beliefs, and stop thinking <em>“you can’t do it”</em>. I want to not only tell myself <em>“you CAN do it, It’ll 
                  take time, work and effort, it won’t be easy, but it is possible”</em>, but actually believe it and act 
                  on it. I know I need to be more forgiving towards myself, because I deserve it!
                </p>

              <div>
                <h2 id="workload">Workload management</h2>
                <h4>Working productively and safely with others</h4>
                <p>
                  Something that works well for me is a strict routine, and knowing when to stop. I will set 
                  boundaries between study/work time and home time. I don’t mind staying late on the EDA campus 
                  (if we’re allowed to), but as soon as I come home, it’s home time.
                </p>
                <h4>What to do when things start to build up and get to me</h4>
                <p>
                  I will disconnect for a moment and do something completely non-tech related, so that my brain 
                  can focus on something lighter and let the new information sink in in the background. 
                  When I learned the basics of javascript for the first time, I spent hours stuck on the concept of
                  nested arrays and loops. I dit not allow myself to rest until I would understand it 
                  (which did NOT work). That day, I went to bed angry and frustrated. After a good night’s sleep 
                  though, it magically clicked in the morning. So I know taking some distance is healthy and 
                  necessary when you learn heavy subjects for the first time.

                <h2 id="help">Asking for help</h2>
                <p>
                  A good programmer needs to know how to Google, so I will try to figure things out myself first. 
                  If it takes too long and I’m still stuck, I will ask my peers or tutors/facilitators for help. 
                  That’s what they’re here for, especially as we’re students in a learning environment (I know you 
                  never really stop learning when you’re a professional, but when everything is new, asking for 
                  help is essential).

                <p>
                  It's a long and intense journey ahead of us, so I think everyone will need to feel supported mentally (they're
                  already doing a great job at that!). Additionally, when I feel stuck, I would love to be guided towards a solution 
                  to my problem, to help me find it myself, rather than being given the answer.

                <p>
                  I’m lucky enough to be able to fully commit to this course, I don’t have anything planned for 
                  the next three months.
