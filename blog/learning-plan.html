            <h2 id="career">My long term career pathway</h2>
            <p>
              I can think of two main options for me. Either work for a web-development or SAAS company, or work 
              freelance on personal projects my partner and I have. It’s too early to say, because even though I’m 
              enjoying this course so far and I like front-end development, I have no idea what being a web 
              developer really involves (I have never done back-end, or database, or even languages other than JS, 
              CSS and HTML). Maybe I’ll realise being in the heart of tech is not for me and I’ll turn to other 
              options while staying in the industry. 
              <p>Long story short, I don’t know! One step at a time is my motto.</p>

              <h2 id="learning-style">My learning style: strengths and weaknesses</h2>
              <p>
                My strong empathetic nature helps me understand people’s needs and feelings. I’m good at always 
                choosing my words carefully or behaving in a mindful way. This makes me a good team player. I’ve 
                always thought learning and growing together as a group is more effective and powerful, which is 
                the main reason why I enrolled in this course. I’ve tried twice to learn on my own and never 
                succeeded. However, as an INFJ, I’m very sensitive and prone to stress and anxiety. This can be 
                both a strength and weakness. I’ve used stress before as a really effective motivator. But in 
                negative environments where I don’t feel supported or listened to, it sucks all my energy and motivation away and tends to freeze me. It all comes down again to empathy and finding the right fit!
