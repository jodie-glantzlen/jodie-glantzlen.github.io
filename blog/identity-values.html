          <h2>Core personal values</h2>
          <p>
            I was born and grew up in France and had a pretty peaceful childhood there. 
            My teenage years however led me through a series of hardships which forever shaped the person I am today.
            There was a point in my life where I was in a very dark space and I didn’t receive the support I needed, 
            so I had to rely on my own <b>determination</b> to save myself. At 22 years old, I moved to the other 
            side of the (my) world, alone, with no specific goal in mind apart from leaving that space I was in.
            It was hard and scary, but my <b>determination</b> helped hugely. Today, I can say that moving to 
            New Zealand six years ago is an achievement I’m grateful for and proud of. Shaping my adult life here as 
            well as a good amount of therapy helped me look retrospectively at my past experiences, and I realised 
            that <b>kindness</b> and <b>empathy</b> are some of the best things you can offer someone.
            I know I would have loved to receive some when I needed it the most, so I strive everyday to be kind 
            and sensitive to anyone that crosses my path, because you never know what people are going through. 
            I believe that anyone in need of help, whatever it may be,can achieve a lot if they feel genuinely 
            listened to and encouraged. My previous career as a teacher definitely confirmed that!

            When I took the 
            <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" target="_blank">Myerrs Brigs’ personality type test</a>, 
            it was not much of a surprise to find out it's <b>INFJ</b> (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging). 
            Apparently I’m a <b>Turbulent Advocate</b>, which sounds quite cool.
