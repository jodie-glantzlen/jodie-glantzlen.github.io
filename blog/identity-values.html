            <h3>Determination. Empathy. Kindness.</h3>
            <p>
              I was born and grew up in France and had a pretty peaceful childhood there. 
              My teenage years however led me through a series of hardships which forever shaped the person I am today.
              There was a point in my life where I was in a very dark space and I didn’t receive the support I needed, 
              so I had to rely on my own <b>determination</b> to save myself. At 22 years old, I moved to the other 
              side of the (my) world, alone, with no specific goal in mind apart from leaving that space I was in.
              It was hard and scary, but my determination helped hugely. Today, I can say that moving to 
              New Zealand six years ago is an achievement I’m grateful for and proud of. Shaping my adult life here as 
              well as a good amount of therapy helped me look retrospectively at my past experiences, and I realised 
              that <b>kindness</b> and <b>empathy</b> are some of the best things you can offer someone.
              I know I would have loved to receive some when I needed it the most, so I strive everyday to be kind 
              and sensitive to anyone that crosses my path, because you never know what people are going through. 
              I believe that anyone in need of help, whatever it may be,can achieve a lot if they feel genuinely 
              listened to and encouraged. My previous career as a teacher definitely confirmed that!
            </p>
            <p>
              When I took the 
              <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" target="_blank">Myerrs Brigs’ personality type test</a>, 
              it was not much of a surprise to find out it's <b>INFJ</b> (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging). 
              Apparently I’m a <b>Turbulent Advocate</b>, which sounds quite cool.

            <h2 id="ethical-decisions">Daily ethical decisions</h2>
            <p>
              My empathetic nature comes in pair with daily ethical decisions. Over the past few years, 
              I’ve become increasingly aware of the beautiful world we live in and how fragile it is. 
              I do my best to embrace a lifestyle that has the least possible impact on the planet, which involves 
              making ethical decisions everyday. Veganism and sustainability are part of my routine, they affect the 
              way I eat, shop and look after my body and mind, which has consequences on many points: It takes away a 
              lot of the easy, cheap and quick eating/shopping options, which can be a hassle sometimes. 
              My determination plays an important role here. It motivates me to walk to different parts of town to 
              find groceries from a refill/bulk shop rather than the supermarket across the street, and reduce the 
              amount of plastic waste in my home. It made me give up meat and dairy, even though they’re a major part 
              of the French culinary culture I grew up in. It develops my curiosity and creativity, as I sometimes need 
              to come up with my own zero-waste alternatives.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m aware my small, daily actions don’t have much of an impact on the bigger scale (but that's the whole
              point of having personal values and live by them, isnt'it). I’m also aware that ethical alternatives 
              are not accessible to everyone, both in terms of affordability and access to knowledge. I’m grateful to 
              be able to follow my convictions and I hope someday they’ll become a norm rather than a privilege. 
              I believe new technologies will have a role to play in this, which is a huge motivator for me to engage 
              in this course.

            <h2 id="culture">Culture(s) and influence</h2>
            <p>
              Growing up in France and more generally in the Western culture, where everything moves so fast and is 
              made to be convenient and single use, definitely challenges my values on a daily basis. But the more 
              I’m being challenged the stronger my determination grows. It also taught me the importance of 
              communication and speaking freely about how I think and feel. However, over the past six years, 
              I have come to realise that New Zealand culture does not encourage or value the same thing, especially 
              among men. This difference has created a desire to promote open and honest communication among human 
              beings, and the huge role of mental health in our daily lives.

            <p>
              Generally speaking: I can easily understand the needs and feelings of people around me, and I’m always 
              mindful of how my words or actions can affect them. But in return, I can be quite sensitive to 
              unwarranted criticism and struggle with stress management.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of my learning and career development, my empathy makes me strive in teams and I’m always happy 
              to collaborate and help others develop their skills. Funnily enough though, I wouldn’t call myself an 
              extrovert. As much as I value encouragement and kindness, it can take some time for me to open up to 
              people and get out of my shell. I need to feel that I can trust my peers and receive the same amount of 
              empathy from them. The same goes for employers or managers. There have been times in the past when I 
              really struggled to function under stressful and toxic work environments, where there was no space for 
              mature communication. I find it difficult to be loyal and give my time to an employer who doesn’t listen.
            </p>
            <p>
              The strength that will help the most in this Dev Academy journey will probably be my ability to
              work hard and stay focused on my goals. As mentioned previously, I'm a very determined person. 
              I don't like giving up. The key is to listen to my body and mind and know when to stop. But more on that 
              in my Learning Plan!

              A previous role I held was as a French teacher in a language school in Auckland. 
              Mid-year, a new director arrived, and it didn't go very well. Firstly, there was a pretty major 
              personality clash between them and me. But more importantly, they didn’t come from a teaching 
              background and didn’t know anything about second language acquisition theory and how it should be 
              applied in the classes. This in itself is not really an issue if you’re not teaching. 
              But they decided to make major changes to how we, teachers, should teach or organise our classes, 
              without consulting with us first.
            </p>
            <p>
              On several occasions we spoke openly in our staff meetings about this. I was very firm and strong about 
              what I thought was right, with evidence from my education and previous experience. It was all the 
              teachers versus them. Unfortunately, it didn’t result in any meaningful change as I believe they 
              felt a bit confronted and therefore less likely to implement our suggestions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe a better way to handle the situation would have been to communicate directly one-on-one with them. 
              I think this would have helped lead to more sustainable solutions without the need for them 
              to keep up appearances in front of the team.
