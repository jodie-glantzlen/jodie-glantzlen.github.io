          <h2>Core personal values</h2>
          <p>
            I was born and grew up in France and had a pretty peaceful childhood there. 
            My teenage years however led me through a series of hardships which forever shaped the person I am today.
            There was a point in my life where I was in a very dark space and I didn’t receive the support I needed, 
            so I had to rely on my own <b>determination</b> to save myself. At 22 years old, I moved to the other 
            side of the (my) world, alone, with no specific goal in mind apart from leaving that space I was in.
            It was hard and scary, but my <b>determination</b> helped hugely. Today, I can say that moving to 
            New Zealand six years ago is an achievement I’m grateful for and proud of. Shaping my adult life here as 
            well as a good amount of therapy helped me look retrospectively at my past experiences, and I realised 
            that <b>kindness</b> and <b>empathy</b> are some of the best things you can offer someone.
            I know I would have loved to receive some when I needed it the most, so I strive everyday to be kind 
            and sensitive to anyone that crosses my path, because you never know what people are going through. 
            I believe that anyone in need of help, whatever it may be,can achieve a lot if they feel genuinely 
            listened to and encouraged. My previous career as a teacher definitely confirmed that!

            When I took the

            it was not much of a surprise to find out it's <b>INFJ</b> (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging). 
            Apparently I’m a <b>Turbulent Advocate</b>, which sounds quite cool.

          <h2>Daily ethical decisions</h2>
          <p>
            My empathetic nature comes in pair with daily ethical decisions. Over the past few years, 
            I’ve become increasingly aware of the beautiful world we live in and how fragile it is. 
            I do my best to embrace a lifestyle that has the least possible impact on the planet, which involves 
            making ethical decisions everyday. Veganism and sustainability are part of my routine, they affect the 
            way I eat, shop and look after my body and mind, which has consequences on many points: It takes away a 
            lot of the easy, cheap and quick eating/shopping options, which can be a hassle sometimes. 
            My determination plays an important role here. It motivates me to walk to different parts of town to 
            find groceries from a refill/bulk shop rather than the supermarket across the street, and reduce the 
            amount of plastic waste in my home. It made me give up meat and dairy, even though they’re a major part 
            of the French culinary culture I grew up in. It develops my curiosity and creativity, as I sometimes need 
            to come up with my own zero-waste alternatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m aware my small, daily actions don’t have much of an impact on the bigger scale (but that's the whole
            point of having personal values and live by them, isnt'it). I’m also aware that ethical alternatives 
            are not accessible to everyone, both in terms of affordability and access to knowledge. I’m grateful to 
            be able to follow my convictions and I hope someday they’ll become a norm rather than a privilege. 
            I believe new technologies will have a role to play in this, which is a huge 
      motivator for me to engage in this course.
