              IQ is a test of intelligence (not to be confused with knowledge).
              It measures cognitive skills such as:
              <ul>
                <li>language</li>
                <li>reasoning abilities</li>
                <li>processing speed</li>
                <li>visual-spatial processing</li>
                <li>memory</li>
                <li>maths</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              EQ measures emotional skills such as:
              <ul>
                <li>understanding and regulating our own mood and emotions</li>
                <li>recognising how other people feel and empathise with them</li>
                <li>solving emotional problems and getting their needs met</li>
                <li>influencing others</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </div>

            <p>
              One of the first things to know is that having a lower emotional intelligence does NOT make you a bad person. 
              It varies a lot from individual to individual, because it is based on life experiences, the environment we grew up in, the people
              we meet or live with. Working on your emotional intelligence is possible and encouraged, for many reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recognising your emotions and noticing what triggers negative AND positive feelings is a tremendous asset which helps 
              you cope with daily life (from small inconveniences to stressful events). Life is confusing and complex. One day it’s 
              going smoothly, the next day it throws obstacles right in your face. Knowing yourself and your reaction to feelings is like having 
              a helpful, wise twin on your shoulder who guides you towards what you need to deal with those inevitable challenges.
              Being emotionally self-aware inevitably makes you aware of others, which affects your personal life as well as your 
              professional life. It makes you a better friend, partner or workmate.
