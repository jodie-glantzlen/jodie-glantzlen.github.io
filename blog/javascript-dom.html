            <h2>HTML, CSS, Javascript: an analogy</h2>
            <p>
              Before it's given any content, a website is a bit like an empty house. No rooms, no floors, nothing. Think of HTML as a builder and CSS as an 
              artist. HTML will give your house a structure, by building floors, rooms, furniture, etc. Then CSS will make your house colourful, organised and pretty. 
              It will paint the walls, organise the layout of each room, make your furniture smaller or bigger... Easy! Finally, Javascript is kind of the handyman who will take care
              of everything related to <em>interacting</em> with your house. Like opening doors, closing windows, switching the lights on and off, taking a shower...

            <h2>JS control flow and loops</h2>
            <h3>Tech explanation</h3>
            <p>
              Control flow in JavaScript is how your computer runs code from top to bottom. It starts from the first line and ends at the last line, unless it 
              hits any statement that changes the direction. An example of such statements would be loops. Loops run based on if a certain condition is true. 
              <em>As long as it stays true, the code is going to keep executing.</em>
            </p>
            <h3>Non-tech translation</h3>
            <p>
              I'm French, and I love crêpes! So today I'm going to keep making crêpes, following the recipe from top to bottom, until I run out of milk. 
              <em>As long as I've got milk, the crêpes are going to keep being made.</em>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>I'm making my first batch of crêpes.</li>
              <li>Still got milk? Yup!</li>
              <li>Let's make another one.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>I'm making my second batch of crêpes.</li>
              <li>Still got milk? <em>Oui!</em></li>
              <li>Okay, third batch incoming.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>I'm making my third batch of crêpes.</li>
              <li>Oh no. No milk left.</li>
              <li>No more crêpes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>
            <p>
              Remember: When you make a website (or a house), HTML defines the structure, CSS provides the appearance and styling, and Javascript deals with interactivity 
            (or water, power and Internet connections in your house).
            </p>
            <p>
              One important thing to know is that Javascript is a sort of wizard, because it has the ability to modify not only what happens in its own domain, but also
              within HTML and CSS. All of Javascript's abilities are accessed by the real MVP of the web... the DOM!
              It’s the <em>special glue</em> that ties everything together. It provides the <em>missing link</em> that ties your HTML and CSS with JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              To keep it simple, the DOM is like a special gateway to all the HTML and CSS elements, and it has functionality that allows Javascript to interact with 
              those elements. For example:
            </p>
            <img src="../resources/images/dom1.png" alt="" class="img-shadow">
            <p>Let's have a look at the HTML and CSS rendering these beautiful dots:</p>
            <img src="../resources/images/dom2.png" alt="" class="img-shadow">
            <img src="../resources/images/dom3.png" alt="" class="img-shadow">
            <p>Our HTML elements haven't been given any class, but our dots definitely have colour... why?</p>
            <img src="../resources/images/dom4.png" alt="" class="img-shadow">
            <p>There you go. <code>document</code>, <code>getClass</code>, <code>getElementbyId</code>, etc, are DOM-side <em>references</em> to their corresponding HTML and CSS
            elements, and these references allow Javascript to interact with them and perfom its magic.</p>
            <p>You can access the DOM and interact with it by using the Chrome Dev Tools. For example, clicking on an HTML element will show you all its attributes and 
              properties:</p>

            <h2>Accessing data from objects vs arrays</h2>
            <h3>Objects</h3>
            <p>
              Think of objects as ID cards. They're used to represent something that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics.
            </p>
            <img src="../resources/images/object1.png" alt="">
            <p>In tech language, these characteristics are called <em>properties</em>. They consist of a <code>key</code> and a <code>value</code>. For example, 
              <code>name</code> is our <code>key</code> and <code>'Jodie'</code> is our value. </p>
            <p>To access properties of an object, we use <b>dot (or bracket) notation</b>, like so:</p>
            <img src="../resources/images/object2.png" alt="">
            <h3>Arrays</h3>
            <p>Think of arrays as big baskets in which you can put items in individual compartments. Each of these compartments are numbered and ordered, and they're called <em>indexes</em>.</p>
            <img src="../resources/images/arr1.png" alt="">
            <p>Now we can't actually see those numbers, but now that we know they're here, we can use them to access our array's data with <b>bracket notation</b>.
              Beware! never forget this very interesting programming trick: indexes start counting at <b>0</b>, not 1, like we poor humans do.
            </p>
