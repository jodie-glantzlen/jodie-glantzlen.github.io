            <h2>HTML vs CSS: an analogy</h2>
            <p>
              Let’s say you have a completely empty house: no rooms, no floors, nothing. Think of HTML as a builder and CSS as an 
              artist/painter. HTML will build your house a structure, by giving it different floors, rooms, furniture, etc. Then CSS 
              will make your house colourful, organised and pretty! It will paint the walls, organise the layout of each room, make 
              your furniture smaller or bigger, etc. Easy!
            </p>

            <h2>JS control flow and loops</h2>
            <p>
              Control flow in JavaScript is how your computer runs code from top to bottom. It starts from the first line and ends at the last line, <b>unless</b> it 
              hits any statement that changes the direction.
            </p>
            <p>
              An example of such statements would be loops. They're iteration statements that will keep running until there is either nothing left to loop over, or if 
              the condition under which they run becomes false.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't understand a word I'm saying? Yeah, me neither. Let's start again with an example from our daily life. I'm French, and I love crêpes. So today, 
              I'm gonna keep making crêpes until I run out of milk.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>I'm making my first batch of crêpes.</li>
              <li>Still got milk? Yup!</li>
              <li>Let's make another one.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>I'm making my second batch of crêpes.</li>
              <li>Still got milk? <em>Oui!</em></li>
              <li>Okay, third batch incoming.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>I'm making my third batch of crêpes.</li>
              <li>Oh no. No milk left.</li>
              <li>No more crêpes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Tech explanation: Loops are conditional, meaning that it runs based on if a certain condition is true. As long as it stays true, the code is going to 
              keep executing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Non-tech translation: As long as there’s milk in my fridge, the crêpes are going to keep being made.
